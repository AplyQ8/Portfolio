# 🛡️ ADTransformer

**A tool for security analysis of Attack-Defence Trees via model checking and trade-off exploration**

---

## 📌 Description

**ADTransformer** is a hybrid toolchain for the formal analysis of **Attack-Defence Trees (ADTs)**.  
Its main goal is to support **automated reasoning about trade-offs** between attacker and defender strategies using **multi-objective analysis**.

The tool takes as input an XML model generated by [**ADTool**](https://satoss.uni.lu/members/piotr/adtool/), parses it into an intermediate representation, and then **translates the ADT into a PRISM model** for analysis via probabilistic model checking.

Optionally, ADTransformer can **automatically generate the Pareto front**, providing a visual and computational representation of trade-offs between conflicting attacker/defender objectives.

- 🧮 **Multi-objective analysis** with PRISM model checker
- 📈 **Automatic Pareto Front generation**
- 🧩 Support for different attacker/defender cost and success metrics
- 🎯 Enables formal reasoning about **attack feasibility**, **defence cost**, and **security trade-offs**
